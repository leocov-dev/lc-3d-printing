# 3D Print Files

A collection of OpenSCAD files of 3D printable objects.

Each `.scad` file should have an accompanying image to show its contents. 

These are for various personal projects and ideas.
Some files may be empty or incomplete.
They might NOT be "print ready" - their orientation and composition in the `.scad` files may need adjustment for a successful print.

### Dependencies

* OpenScad >= 2019.05
* BOSL2 (included as git submodule in `/vendor`)

### Lib

The `/_lib` directory contains various utility modules and functions.
